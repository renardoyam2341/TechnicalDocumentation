            Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.

          <p>Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.

It is used for:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              web development (server-side)

            Many PCs and Macs will have python already installed.

            Python is an interpreted programming language, this means that as a developer you write Python (.py) files in a text editor and then put those files into the python interpreter to be executed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Simple as that. Save your file. Open your command line, navigate to the directory where you saved your file, and run.

          As we learned in the previous page, Python syntax can be executed by writing directly in the Command Line:
          <code
            > print("Hello, World!")
Hello, World!
          </code>

          Or by creating a python file on the server, using the .py file extension, and running it.

      <section class="main-section" id="Comments">
        <header>Comments</header>
        <p>
          Comments can be used to explain Python code.

Comments can be used to make the code more readable.

Comments can be used to prevent execution when testing code.
Comments starts with a #, and Python will ignore them:
<code>#This is a comment
print("Hello, World!")</code>
        </p>
        <p>
          Python does not really have a syntax for multi line comments.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since Python will ignore string literals that are not assigned to a variable, you can add a multiline string (triple quotes) in your code, and place your comment inside it.

          Variables are containers for storing data values.Python has no command for declaring a variable.

A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.
          <p>
            For example, <code>x = 5
y = "John"
print(x)
print(y)</code> This
            syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.
          </p>
          <p>
            Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and can even change type after they have been set. For example,
            <code>x = 4       # x is of type int
x = "Sally" # x is now of type str
print(x)</code> 
          </p>
          <p>
            If you want to specify the data type of a variable, this can be done with casting. For example,<code> x = str(3)    # x will be '3'
y = int(3)    # y will be 3
z = float(3)  # z will be 3.0</code> 
          </p>
